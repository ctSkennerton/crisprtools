some tools that might be handy:

* Merge - two or more .crispr files together
* Split - a .crispr file apart
* Filter - remove/copy groups if they fit/don't fit criteria
    + number of spacers
* Extract - fasta sequences
    + direct repeats
    + spacers
    + flankers
    + concensus sequences
* Draw - a graphviz representation of the crispr
* Sanitise - change all the unique ids to incrementing numbers
* Extract/Add metadata
