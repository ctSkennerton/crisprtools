Crisprtools is written in c++ and uses [libcrispr](ctskennerton.github.com/libcrispr) for all the heavy lifting.  \r\n\r\n### What do you get?\r\nCrisprtools is implemented as a single unix command-line executable that contains a number of subcommands, each for performing a type of query or manipulation of a crispr file.  Currently the subcommands are:\r\n\r\n* stat\r\n* extract\r\n* filter\r\n* rm\r\n* merge\r\n* draw\r\n* sanitise\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nCrisprtools is built using the GNU build system (autoconf) so in most unix systems you should be able to type the following commands:\r\n```\r\n[./autogen.sh]\r\n./configure\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nNote that you must have `libcrispr` installed on your system first\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCrisprtools was primarily written by Connor Skennerton (@ctSkennerton) with contributions from Mike Imelfort (@minillinim)\r\n\r\n### Found A bug?\r\nLog an issue on [github](https://github.com/ctSkennerton/crisprtools/issues) and I'll get right on it\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n     crisprtools <command> [<args>] <file.crispr>\r\n\r\n#####Commands and Options:\r\n\r\n     merge [-hso OUTFILE] file1.crispr file2.crispr [1,n]\r\n\t      take two or more .crispr files and merge them together\r\n\r\n\t      -h       Output help message\r\n\t      -s       Sanitise the group names in the resulting output file\r\n\t\t       so that all groups have consecutive identifiers, and\r\n\t\t       that there are no clashes between group numbers\r\n\t      -o OUTFILE\r\n\t\t       Specify an output file for the merged .crispr file\r\n\t\t       [default: crisprtools_merged.crispr ]\r\n\r\n     sanitise [-ohcsdf] file.crispr\r\n\t      change names and accession numbers of groups, spacers and\r\n\t      flankers\r\n\r\n\t      -h       Output help message\r\n\t      -o OUTFILE\r\n\t\t       Output file name, creates a sanitised copy of the input\r\n\t\t       file  [default: sanitise input file inplace]\r\n\t      -s       Sanitise the spacers\r\n\t      -c       Sanitise the contigs\r\n\t      -d       Sanitise the direct repeats\r\n\t      -f       Sanitise the flanking sequences\r\n\r\n     extract [-ghyxsdfCoO] file.crispr\r\n\t      get data out of a .crispr file\r\n\r\n\t      -h       print this handy help message\r\n\t      -o DIR   Output file directory  [default: .]\r\n\t      -O STRING\r\n\t\t       Give a custom prefix to each of the outputed files\r\n\t\t       [default: ]\r\n\t      -g INT[,n]\r\n\t\t       A comma separated list of group IDs that you would like\r\n\t\t       to extract data from.
